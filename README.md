Threat Research Data
===============

# UPDATE 01/26/2015

All threat-related research has been moved to a centralized (and automated) Github repository. All data can be found [here](https://github.com/animus-project/threat_data).

## Summary

This page contains data I've collected over the past several months using a network of 10-20 SSH honeypots. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out and contact me. 

Credit to Robin Wood (Digininja) for building Pipal, the tool I used for statistical analysis on the passwords.

*all_ranges_sorted.txt* contains all class C IP ranges that have ever attempted to login to any of my sensors. Please keep in mind that this may contain some benign hosts, as I'm aggregating based on range, not necessarily host. Also, I've removed any networks that include less than 100 total malicious attempts to filter out small fish. If you'd like access to the raw data, don't hesitate to contact me.
